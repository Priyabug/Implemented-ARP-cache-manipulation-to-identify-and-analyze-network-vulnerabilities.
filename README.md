<h2>Description</h2>
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer
address, such as the MAC address, given an IP address. The ARP protocol is a very simple protocol, and
it does not implement any security measure. The ARP cache poisoning attack is a common attack against
the ARP protocol. Using such an attack, attackers can fool the victim into accepting forged IP-to-MAC
mappings. This can cause the victimâ€™s packets to be redirected to the computer with the forged MAC
address, leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

<h2>Shell scripts commands</h2>

- `./dc-build.sh` - Build the docker images, it can take one additional parameter to be used in the build process, e.g. `./dc-build.sh --no-cache`.
- `./dc-up.sh` - Start the docker containers in the foreground.
- `./dc-up-d.sh` - Start the docker containers in the background.
- `./dc-stop.sh` - Stop the docker containers, it can take one additional parameter to be used in the stop process.
- `./dc-down.sh` - Stop and remove the docker containers, it can take one additional parameter to be used in the stop and remove process.
- `./dc-unittest.sh` - Utility script to aid in running a specific unit test class.

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

- <b> Using Scapy for Sniffing and Spoofing:</b>

     1. Sniffing packets with Scapy, including setting filters to capture specific types of packets (like ICMP or TCP).<br>
     2. Spoofing ICMP packets with arbitrary source IP addresses using Scapy.<br>
     3. Implementing a traceroute-like tool using Scapy by manipulating the TTL (Time-To-Live) field in IP packets.<br>
     4. Combining sniffing and spoofing techniques to create a program that automatically sends spoofed ICMP replies.<br>

- <b> Writing C Programs for Sniffing and Spoofing:</b>
 
     1. Tasks in this set involve writing programs in C to manually implement packet sniffing and spoofing, allowing students to understand the
          low-level implementation details of these techniques.<br>
